# _Frisk's Frenzy_

When falling into the UNDERGROUND yet again, you feel something's different, except, everything's in place. Nothing's off, safe for Flowey not being there and his... replacement... but regardless, nothing's wrong, right?

Ever wonder what **UNDERTALE**'d be like if it were a roguelite? Something like Pokerogue, focusing solely on the battles and giving you challenge after challenge to prevail through?
Me too, so I'm making UFF, or Roguetale (if you're **BORING**!), as an attempt to make a roguelite out of Undertale, while still keeping the general 'FIGHT or show MERCY' shtick. 

At the moment, the game is far from finished, but it's coming along. There are a LOT of features that are meant to be added in the final release and I doubt I'd be able to name them all without either promising too much, or overstaying my welcome, but a few of the inclusions are...

* A luck system, which can be influenced by the player's pregame actions.

* Custom Boss Attacks.

* More out of the routes in general.

* And last but not least, a SPELL system (MP's COMIN' BACK BABY!)
